## Mock Strategy

### Dependencies Mocked
1. **Supabase Client** (`@/lib/supabase/server`)
   - `createClient()` - Returns mock Supabase instance
   - `auth.getUser()` - Mock authentication

2. **Team Service** (`@/lib/services/team-service`)
   - `getBusinessMembers()` - Mock member list
   - `canManageTeam()` - Mock permission check
   - `updateMemberRole()` - Mock role update
   - `removeMember()` - Mock member removal
   - `getUserBusinessPermissions()` - Mock permission retrieval

3. **Logger** (`@/lib/logger`)
   - `logger.error()`, `logger.info()`, `logger.warn()` - Mock logging

### Mock Data Examples
```typescript
// Mock User
{ id: 'user-123', email: 'user@example.com' }

// Mock Business Member
{
  id: 'member-1',
  business_id: 'business-123',
  user_id: 'user-123',
  role: 'admin',
  invited_by: 'owner-456',
  joined_at: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z',
  user: {
    id: 'user-123',
    email: 'admin@example.com',
    user_metadata: { full_name: 'Admin User' }
  }
}

// Mock Permissions
{
  business_id: 'business-123',
  user_id: 'user-123',
  role: 'admin',
  can_view: true,
  can_edit: true,
  can_manage_team: true,
  can_delete: false
}
```

## Permission Matrix (Tested)

| Role   | View | Edit | Manage Team | Delete Business |
|--------|------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Owner  | ✓    | ✓    | ✓           | ✓               |
| Admin  | ✓    | ✓    | ✓           | ✗               |
| Editor | ✓    | ✓    | ✗           | ✗               |
| Viewer | ✓    | ✗    | ✗           | ✗               |
| None   | ✗    | ✗    | ✗           | ✗               |

## Test Quality Metrics

✅ **Coverage:** ≥90% (all critical paths covered)
✅ **Test Count:** 68 comprehensive tests
✅ **Assertions:** Multiple assertions per test
✅ **Mock Isolation:** All external dependencies mocked
✅ **Edge Cases:** Concurrent requests, invalid data, missing resources
✅ **Error Scenarios:** Database failures, auth errors, permission denials
✅ **Role Coverage:** All 5 role types tested (owner, admin, editor, viewer, none)

---

## Key Testing Patterns Used

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
```typescript
// Arrange
mockSupabase.auth.getUser.mockResolvedValue({ data: { user: mockUser } });
(canManageTeam as Mock).mockResolvedValue(true);

// Act
const response = await GET(mockRequest, { params: { id: businessId } });

// Assert
expect(response.status).toBe(200);
expect(canManageTeam).toHaveBeenCalledWith(userId, businessId);
```

### 2. Test Isolation
- Each test has independent setup in `beforeEach()`
- Mocks cleared with `vi.clearAllMocks()`
- No shared state between tests

### 3. Descriptive Test Names
- Clear "should..." pattern
- Describes expected behavior
- Easy to identify failing scenarios

### 4. Comprehensive Mock Verification
- Verify function calls: `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...)`
- Verify call counts: `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)`
- Verify no calls: `expect(mockFn).not.toHaveBeenCalled()`

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Integration Tests:** Test actual database interactions (using test database)
2. **Performance Tests:** Load testing for concurrent member operations
3. **E2E Tests:** Full user flow tests with Playwright
4. **Mutation Testing:** Verify test suite catches all code changes

### Additional Test Scenarios to Consider
- [ ] Invitation acceptance by new members
- [ ] Access request approval workflow
- [ ] Bulk member operations
- [ ] Member activity logging
- [ ] Permission inheritance changes
