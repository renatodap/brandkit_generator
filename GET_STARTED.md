## üêõ Having Issues?

### "Failed to generate logo"
**Solution**: Check your `.env.local` file
- Make sure your API key starts with `hf_`
- No extra spaces before or after the key
- Restart the dev server: Press `Ctrl+C`, then `npm run dev` again

### "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Still not working?
**Check**:
1. Node version: `node --version` (need 18+ or 20+)
2. Internet connection (AI APIs need internet)
3. `.env.local` file exists and has your key
