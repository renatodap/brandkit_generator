# Multi-Business Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete multi-business system for the Brand Kit Generator, allowing users to create multiple businesses within their account, with each business having one brand kit (1:1 relationship).

**Implementation Date**: October 6, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Ready for database migration and testing

---

## What Changed

### Before
- Users directly created brand kits
- No concept of separate "businesses"
- One user → Many brand kits (unorganized)
- Dashboard showed all brand kits directly

### After
- Users create **businesses** first
- Each business can have **one brand kit**
- One user → Many businesses → One brand kit per business
- Dashboard shows businesses with kit status
- Better organization and scalability

---

## Architecture

```
User (auth.users)
  │
  ├─ Business 1 (businesses table)
  │   └─ Brand Kit (brand_kits.business_id = Business 1)
  │
  ├─ Business 2 (businesses table)
  │   └─ Brand Kit (brand_kits.business_id = Business 2)
  │
  └─ Business 3 (businesses table)
      └─ [No Brand Kit Yet]
```

**Key Constraints:**
- `businesses.slug` is unique per user
- `brand_kits.business_id` is NOT NULL and UNIQUE (1:1 relationship)
- Deleting a business cascades to its brand kit

---

## Database Changes

### New Table: `businesses`

```sql
CREATE TABLE businesses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  industry VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  CONSTRAINT unique_user_slug UNIQUE (user_id, slug)
);
```

### Updated Table: `brand_kits`

**New column:**
- `business_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES businesses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE UNIQUE`

**Migration strategy:**
1. Creates a business for each existing brand kit (preserves data)
2. Links brand kits to businesses
3. Makes `business_id` NOT NULL
4. Adds UNIQUE constraint

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All operations enforce user ownership:
- Users can only view/edit/delete their own businesses
- Brand kits are accessible only to business owners
- No data leakage between users

---

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Type Definitions (`types/index.ts`)

```typescript
export interface Business {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description?: string;
  industry?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

export interface BrandKitWithBusiness extends BrandKit {
  business?: Business;
}
```

### 2. Validation Schemas

#### Business Validations (`lib/validations/business.ts`)

```typescript
export const createBusinessSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(255),
  slug: z.string().min(2).max(255).regex(/^[a-z0-9-]+$/),
  description: z.string().max(1000).optional(),
  industry: z.enum(['tech', 'food', 'fashion', 'health', 'creative', 'finance', 'education', 'other']).optional(),
});

export const updateBusinessSchema = createBusinessSchema.partial();

export function generateSlug(name: string): string {
  return name
    .toLowerCase()
    .trim()
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/-+/g, '-')
    .replace(/^-|-$/g, '');
}
```

#### Updated Brand Kit Validation (`lib/validations/brand-kit.ts`)

```typescript
export const createBrandKitSchema = z.object({
  businessId: z.string().uuid(), // NEW: Required
  businessName: z.string().min(1).max(255),
  businessDescription: z.string().optional(),
  // ... rest of fields
});
```

### 3. Service Layer

#### Business Service (`lib/services/business-service.ts`)

Complete CRUD service with RLS enforcement:

```typescript
// Create business
export async function createBusiness(userId: string, data: CreateBusinessInput): Promise<Business>

// List businesses with filters, sorting, pagination
export async function getBusinesses(userId: string, query: ListBusinessesQuery): Promise<ListBusinessesResult>

// Get businesses with brand kits in single query (uses JOIN)
export async function getBusinessesWithBrandKits(userId: string, query: ListBusinessesQuery): Promise<ListBusinessesWithBrandKitsResult>

// Get single business
export async function getBusinessById(businessId: string, userId: string): Promise<Business>

// Get business by slug
export async function getBusinessBySlug(slug: string, userId: string): Promise<Business>

// Update business
export async function updateBusiness(businessId: string, userId: string, data: UpdateBusinessInput): Promise<Business>

// Delete business (cascades to brand kit)
export async function deleteBusiness(businessId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Check slug availability
export async function isSlugAvailable(slug: string, userId: string, excludeId?: string): Promise<boolean>
```

**Key Feature: Optimized JOIN Query**

`getBusinessesWithBrandKits()` uses a SQL LEFT JOIN to fetch businesses and their brand kits in a single database query, preventing N+1 query problems:

```typescript
const { data, error, count } = await supabase
  .from('businesses')
  .select(`
    *,
    brand_kits (
      id, business_name, logo_url, logo_svg, colors, fonts, tagline,
      industry, is_favorite, created_at, updated_at
    )
  `, { count: 'exact' })
  .eq('user_id', userId);
```

#### Updated Brand Kit Service (`lib/services/brand-kit-service.ts`)

```typescript
// Updated to require businessId and enforce ownership
export async function createBrandKit(userId: string, data: CreateBrandKitInput): Promise<BrandKit> {
  // 1. Verify business exists and belongs to user
  // 2. Check business doesn't already have a kit
  // 3. Create brand kit
}

// NEW: Get brand kit by business ID
export async function getBrandKitByBusinessId(businessId: string, userId: string): Promise<BrandKit | null>
```

### 4. API Routes

#### Business Endpoints

**`POST /api/businesses`**
- Create new business
- Body: `{ name, slug, description?, industry? }`
- Returns: Business object

**`GET /api/businesses`**
- List user's businesses
- Query params: `limit`, `offset`, `sort`, `order`, `industry`, `include`
- `include=brand_kits` - Returns businesses with brand kit data (uses JOIN)
- Returns: `{ businesses, total, limit, offset }`

**`GET /api/businesses/:id`**
- Get single business by ID
- Returns: Business object

**`PATCH /api/businesses/:id`**
- Update business
- Body: `{ name?, slug?, description?, industry? }`
- Returns: Updated business object

**`DELETE /api/businesses/:id`**
- Delete business (cascades to brand kit)
- Returns: Success message with warning if kit existed

**`GET /api/businesses/check-slug`**
- Check slug availability
- Query params: `slug` (required), `excludeId` (optional for updates)
- Returns: `{ available: boolean }`

#### Updated Brand Kit Endpoint

**`POST /api/generate-brand-kit`**
- **Now requires `businessId` in request body**
- Validates business ownership before creating kit
- Enforces one kit per business constraint

---

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. UI Components

#### Badge Component (`components/ui/badge.tsx`)
- shadcn/ui Badge component
- Used for industry tags and "Has Brand Kit" status
- Variants: default, secondary, destructive, outline

#### Dialog Component (`components/ui/dialog.tsx`)
- shadcn/ui Dialog primitive
- Used for Create/Edit business modals
- Full accessibility support

#### DropdownMenu Component (`components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`)

- Used for Edit/Delete actions in business cards
- Keyboard navigation support

#### AlertDialog Component (`components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`)
- shadcn/ui AlertDialog
- Used for delete confirmation
- Warns about brand kit deletion

### 2. Business Components

#### BusinessCard Component (`components/business-card.tsx`)

Displays a business with:
- Logo preview (from brand kit or placeholder)
- Business name and industry badge
- "Has Brand Kit" badge
- Description and creation date
- Dropdown menu for Edit/Delete actions
- CTA button: "Generate Brand Kit" OR "View Brand Kit"

```typescript
interface BusinessCardProps {
  business: Business & {
    brand_kit: any | null;
    has_brand_kit: boolean;
  };
  onGenerateKit: (businessId: string) => void;
  onViewKit: (brandKitId: string) => void;
  onEdit: (business: Business) => void;
  onDelete: (business: Business) => void;
}
```

#### CreateBusinessDialog Component (`components/create-business-dialog.tsx`)

Modal form for creating businesses with:
- Auto-slug generation from business name
- Real-time slug availability checking (500ms debounce)
- Industry selection
- Full validation with Zod
- Loading states
- Success/error toasts

**Features:**
- Slug auto-fills as user types name
- Green checkmark when slug is available
- Red X when slug is taken
- Debounced API calls to `/api/businesses/check-slug`

#### EditBusinessDialog Component (`components/edit-business-dialog.tsx`)

Modal form for editing businesses with:
- Pre-fills with existing business data
- Slug validation excludes current business ID
- Auto-generates new slug if name changes
- Same validation as create dialog
- Updates business via PATCH `/api/businesses/:id`

### 3. Page Updates

#### Dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Complete refactor:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Fetched brand kits directly
const brandKits = await fetch('/api/brand-kits');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Fetches businesses with brand kits using JOIN
const { businesses } = await fetch('/api/businesses?include=brand_kits');

// Each business has:
// - brand_kit: BrandKit | null
// - has_brand_kit: boolean
```

**New Features:**
- Grid layout of BusinessCard components
- Create Business button in header
- Empty state for no businesses
- Edit business functionality
- Delete business with confirmation dialog
- Warning when deleting business with brand kit

**Handlers:**
```typescript
const handleGenerateKit = (businessId: string) => {
  router.push(`/tools/brand-kit?businessId=${businessId}`);
};

const handleViewKit = (brandKitId: string) => {
  router.push(`/brand-kit/${brandKitId}`);
};

const handleEdit = (business: Business) => {
  setEditingBusiness(business);
  setShowEditDialog(true);
};

const handleDelete = (business: BusinessWithBrandKit) => {
  setDeletingBusiness(business);
  // Shows AlertDialog with warning if has_brand_kit is true
};
```

#### Brand Kit Generation (`app/tools/brand-kit/page.tsx`)

**Complete refactor:**

**Now requires `businessId` query parameter:**
```typescript
const businessId = searchParams?.get('businessId');

useEffect(() => {
  if (!businessId) {
    toast.error('Please select a business first');
    router.push('/dashboard');
    return;
  }

  // Fetch business and pre-fill form
  const business = await fetch(`/api/businesses/${businessId}`);
  setValue('businessId', business.id);
  setValue('businessName', business.name);
  setValue('businessDescription', business.description);
  setValue('industry', business.industry);
}, [businessId]);
```

**Features:**
- Validates business exists
- Checks if business already has brand kit (redirects if yes)
- Disables business name field (pre-filled from business)
- Passes `businessId` to generation API
- Loading/error states

---

## User Flow

### New User Flow

1. **User lands on dashboard** → Sees "No businesses yet" empty state
2. **Clicks "Create Business"** → Opens CreateBusinessDialog
3. **Fills business details** → Name auto-generates slug, checks availability
4. **Submits** → Business created, redirected to dashboard
5. **Sees business card** → Shows "Generate Brand Kit" button
6. **Clicks "Generate Brand Kit"** → Routed to `/tools/brand-kit?businessId=xxx`
7. **Form pre-filled** → Business name/description/industry already set
8. **Generates kit** → Brand kit created and linked to business
9. **Returns to dashboard** → Business card now shows "View Brand Kit" button

### Existing User Flow (After Migration)

1. **Migration runs** → Creates businesses from existing brand kits
2. **User logs in** → Sees businesses in dashboard
3. **Existing brand kits** → Automatically linked to businesses
4. **Can continue** → Creating new businesses or viewing existing kits

---

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Backup Database

**CRITICAL: Always backup before migrations**

```bash
# Via Supabase CLI
supabase db dump -f backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Or via Supabase Dashboard
# Settings → Database → Backups → Create Backup
```

### Step 2: Apply Migration

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy contents of `migrations/add_businesses_table.sql`
5. Paste and click **Run**
6. Verify success (no errors)

**Option B: Via Supabase CLI**

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g supabase

# Login
supabase login

# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Run migration
supabase db execute --file migrations/add_businesses_table.sql
```

### Step 3: Verify Migration

Run these verification queries in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check all brand kits have business_id
SELECT COUNT(*) as brand_kits_without_business
FROM brand_kits
WHERE business_id IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0

-- 2. Check businesses were created
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_businesses FROM businesses;
-- Expected: Number equal to or greater than existing brand kits

-- 3. Verify 1:1 relationship
SELECT business_id, COUNT(*) as kit_count
FROM brand_kits
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows (no business should have multiple kits)

-- 4. View sample data
SELECT b.name, b.slug, bk.business_name, bk.tagline
FROM businesses b
LEFT JOIN brand_kits bk ON bk.business_id = b.id
LIMIT 10;
-- Expected: See businesses with their brand kits
```

### Step 4: Test API Endpoints

```bash
# Test business listing
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/businesses?include=brand_kits" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test business creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/businesses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Business",
    "slug": "test-business",
    "description": "A test business",
    "industry": "tech"
  }'

# Test slug availability
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/businesses/check-slug?slug=test-business" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Step 5: Deploy Frontend Changes

```bash
# Build and test locally
npm run build
npm run start

# Deploy to Vercel (or your hosting platform)
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys on push
```

## Security Audit

### Row Level Security (RLS)

✅ **All tables have RLS enabled**
- `businesses` table: Users can only access their own
- `brand_kits` table: Accessible only through business ownership

### Input Validation

✅ **All inputs validated**
- Zod schemas for all API requests
- SQL injection prevented (Supabase client escapes)
- XSS prevention (React escapes by default)

### Authentication

✅ **All routes protected**
- `/api/businesses/*` - Requires JWT
- `/api/generate-brand-kit` - Requires JWT
- Dashboard page - Redirects if not authenticated

### Authorization

✅ **Business ownership verified**
- Can't create kit for another user's business
- Can't edit/delete another user's business
- Can't view another user's businesses

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database

1. **Indexes created** on:
   - `businesses.user_id`
   - `businesses.slug`
   - `businesses.created_at`
   - `brand_kits.business_id`

2. **JOIN query** for dashboard:
   - Single query instead of N+1 queries
   - Fetches businesses + brand kits in one roundtrip

3. **Efficient filters**:
   - Sorting at database level
   - Pagination support (limit/offset)
   - Industry filtering

### Frontend

1. **Debounced slug checking** (500ms)
   - Prevents excessive API calls
   - Only checks when user stops typing

2. **Optimistic UI updates**:
   - Immediate feedback on actions
   - Updates local state before API response

3. **Loading states**:
   - Skeleton screens while fetching
   - Spinner on button actions
   - Disabled states during operations

---

## Known Edge Cases & Handling

### 1. Duplicate Business Names

**Scenario**: User creates two businesses with same name
**Handling**: Allowed, but slugs must be unique (user manually edits slug)

### 2. Very Long Business Names

**Scenario**: User enters 500-character business name
**Handling**: Validation limits to 255 characters, auto-truncate slug

### 3. Special Characters in Slugs

**Scenario**: User's business name has emojis or special characters
**Handling**: `generateSlug()` strips to alphanumeric + hyphens only

### 4. Existing Brand Kits During Migration

**Scenario**: Multiple brand kits with same business name
**Handling**: Creates separate businesses with unique slugs (appends UUID)

### 5. Concurrent Slug Creation

**Scenario**: Two users create business with same slug simultaneously
**Handling**: Database UNIQUE constraint enforced, second request fails gracefully

### 6. Delete Business with Brand Kit

**Scenario**: User deletes business that has a kit
**Handling**: AlertDialog warns user, ON DELETE CASCADE removes kit

### 7. Business Without Kit

**Scenario**: User creates business but never generates kit
**Handling**: Shows "Generate Brand Kit" button, no errors

### 8. Invalid businessId in URL

**Scenario**: User manually edits `/tools/brand-kit?businessId=invalid`
**Handling**: API returns 404, frontend shows error and redirects to dashboard

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after deployment, you can rollback:

### 1. Rollback Database

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete all businesses and break brand kit relationships
-- Only use if absolutely necessary

ALTER TABLE brand_kits DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS brand_kits_business_id_unique;
ALTER TABLE brand_kits DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS brand_kits_business_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE brand_kits DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS business_id;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS businesses CASCADE;

-- Restore original RLS policies (from backup)
```

### 2. Rollback Code

```bash
# Find commit before multi-business implementation
git log --oneline

# Revert to previous commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or hard reset (destructive)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Force push (if already deployed)
git push origin main --force
```

### 3. Restore Backup

```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard
# Settings → Database → Backups → Restore

# Or via CLI
supabase db restore backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "business_id already exists"

**Cause**: Column already added in previous attempt
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if column exists
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'brand_kits' AND column_name = 'business_id';

-- If exists, drop and re-run migration
ALTER TABLE brand_kits DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS business_id CASCADE;
-- Then re-run full migration
```

### Issue: Some brand kits have NULL business_id after migration

**Cause**: Data matching failed during migration
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Manually create businesses for orphaned kits
INSERT INTO businesses (user_id, name, slug, description, industry, created_at)
SELECT DISTINCT
  user_id,
  business_name,
  lower(regexp_replace(business_name, '[^a-zA-Z0-9\s-]', '', 'g')) || '-' || substr(gen_random_uuid()::text, 1, 8),
  business_description,
  industry,
  created_at
FROM brand_kits
WHERE business_id IS NULL;

-- Link them
UPDATE brand_kits SET business_id = (
  SELECT id FROM businesses WHERE user_id = brand_kits.user_id LIMIT 1
) WHERE business_id IS NULL;
```

### Issue: Slug validation not working

**Cause**: API route not found or auth issue
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check route exists
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/businesses/check-slug?slug=test" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Check browser console for CORS errors
# Verify JWT token is valid
```

### Issue: Dashboard shows empty despite having businesses

**Cause**: `include=brand_kits` query param missing or API error
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Verify API call in dashboard
const response = await fetch('/api/businesses?include=brand_kits');
console.log(await response.json());

// Check network tab for actual request
// Verify RLS policies allow access
```

### Issue: Can't create brand kit for business

**Cause**: Business already has a kit or ownership verification failed
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if business already has kit
SELECT * FROM brand_kits WHERE business_id = 'your-business-id';

-- Check business ownership
SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE id = 'your-business-id' AND user_id = 'your-user-id';
```
