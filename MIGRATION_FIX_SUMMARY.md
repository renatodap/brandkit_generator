# Migration Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: The original migration used `owner_id` as the column name for business owners, but the actual database schema uses `user_id`.

**Error**: `ERROR: 42703: column b.owner_id does not exist`

## 🔧 Files Updated

All references to `owner_id` have been replaced with `user_id`:

1. ✅ **supabase/migrations/team_collaboration.sql**
   - All RLS policies updated
   - Helper functions updated
   - 16 instances replaced

2. ✅ **lib/services/team-service.ts**
   - `getUserRole()` function updated
   - `isOwner()` function updated
   - 4 instances replaced

3. ✅ **app/api/businesses/[id]/members/route.ts**
   - Owner info query updated
   - Foreign key reference updated
   - 3 instances replaced

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

### Actual Schema (from your Supabase):

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.businesses (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,  -- ← This is the owner field!
  name character varying NOT NULL,
  slug character varying NOT NULL,
  ...
);

CREATE TABLE public.brand_kits (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,  -- ← Creator of the brand kit
  business_id uuid NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- ← Link to business
  ...
);
```

## ✅ All Code Now Correctly Uses:

- `businesses.user_id` - The business owner
- `brand_kits.user_id` - The brand kit creator
- `business_members.user_id` - The team member

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

The migration is now ready to run! Follow these steps:

### 1. Run Migration

**Go to**: [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/abtunlcxubymirloekto/sql/new)

**Copy from**: `supabase/migrations/team_collaboration.sql`

**Paste and Run**: Click the green "Run" button

### 2. Verify

Check that these tables were created:
- ✅ `business_members`
- ✅ `business_invitations`
- ✅ `business_access_requests`

### 3. Test

```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Test API endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/businesses/YOUR_BUSINESS_ID/permissions
```

## 📝 What Changed in the Migration

### Before (❌ Wrong):
```sql
-- Incorrect column name
WHERE b.owner_id = auth.uid()
```

### After (✅ Correct):
```sql
-- Correct column name
WHERE b.user_id = auth.uid()
```

1. ✅ **Migration fixed and ready**
2. 📝 Run migration in Supabase Dashboard
3. 🧪 Test API endpoints
4. 🎨 Build Team Management UI
5. 📧 Add email notifications (optional)
