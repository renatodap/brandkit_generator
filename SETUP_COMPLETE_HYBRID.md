## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Schema (5 minutes)

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/abtunlcxubymirloekto/sql/new
   ```

2. Open `supabase-schema-hybrid-accounts.sql` in this project

3. Copy **entire contents** (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)

4. Paste into SQL Editor (Ctrl+V)

5. Click **"RUN"** button

6. Wait for success message (~5-10 seconds)

### Step 2: Verify Schema (2 minutes)

Run this verification query in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check tables created
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name IN ('user_profiles', 'businesses', 'business_members', 'brand_kits', 'share_tokens', 'activity_logs')
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see **6 rows** returned.

### Step 3: Test Sign Up (3 minutes)

1. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/sign-up`

3. You should see:
   - **Account type selection** (Personal vs Business)
   - **Credentials form** after selecting type
   - Auto-creates `user_profiles` entry on signup

4. Create a test account (use temp email if needed)

5. Check Supabase Auth dashboard for new user

6. Check `user_profiles` table for profile entry

### Step 4: Test Business Creation (Optional, 5 minutes)

For **Personal Account**:
```sql
-- Replace USER_ID with your test user's ID
INSERT INTO businesses (name, slug, industry, owner_user_id, is_registered)
VALUES (
  'Test Coffee Shop',
  'test-coffee-shop',
  'Food & Beverage',
  'USER_ID_HERE',
  false
);
```

For **Business Account**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create registered business (no owner)
INSERT INTO businesses (name, slug, industry, is_registered)
VALUES (
  'Test Corp',
  'test-corp',
  'Technology',
  true
)
RETURNING id; -- Save this ID

-- Step 2: Add user as owner
INSERT INTO business_members (business_id, user_id, role, status)
VALUES (
  'BUSINESS_ID_FROM_ABOVE',
  'USER_ID_HERE',
  'owner',
  'active'
);
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Freelance Designer (Personal Account)

**Sarah manages 3 client businesses:**

```sql
-- Sign up as personal account
-- account_type: 'personal'

-- Create client businesses
INSERT INTO businesses (name, slug, owner_user_id, is_registered) VALUES
  ('Client A Coffee', 'client-a-coffee', 'sarah-user-id', false),
  ('Client B Tech', 'client-b-tech', 'sarah-user-id', false),
  ('Client C Fashion', 'client-c-fashion', 'sarah-user-id', false);

-- Create brand kits for each client
INSERT INTO brand_kits (owner_user_id, business_id, created_by_user_id, business_name, logo_url, colors, fonts)
VALUES
  ('sarah-user-id', 'client-a-id', 'sarah-user-id', 'Client A Coffee', '...', '{}', '{}'),
  ('sarah-user-id', 'client-b-id', 'sarah-user-id', 'Client B Tech', '...', '{}', '{}');

-- Sarah can access all her businesses and brand kits
-- Dashboard: /dashboard/personal
```

### Scenario 2: Startup Team (Business Account)

**Acme Corp has 3 team members:**

```sql
-- Create registered business
INSERT INTO businesses (name, slug, is_registered)
VALUES ('Acme Corp', 'acme-corp', true)
RETURNING id;

-- Add team members
INSERT INTO business_members (business_id, user_id, role) VALUES
  ('acme-id', 'founder-id', 'owner'),
  ('acme-id', 'designer-id', 'editor'),
  ('acme-id', 'marketer-id', 'member');

-- Any team member can create brand kits
INSERT INTO brand_kits (owner_user_id, business_id, created_by_user_id, business_name, logo_url, colors, fonts)
VALUES
  ('designer-id', 'acme-id', 'designer-id', 'Acme Corp', '...', '{}', '{}');

-- All team members can see all brand kits
-- Dashboard: /dashboard/acme-corp
```

### Scenario 3: Hybrid User

**Mike is both freelancer AND team member:**

```sql
-- Mike's personal businesses (freelance clients)
INSERT INTO businesses (name, slug, owner_user_id, is_registered) VALUES
  ('Mike Client 1', 'mike-client-1', 'mike-id', false),
  ('Mike Client 2', 'mike-client-2', 'mike-id', false);

-- Mike is also member of two registered businesses
INSERT INTO business_members (business_id, user_id, role) VALUES
  ('acme-corp-id', 'mike-id', 'editor'),
  ('startup-xyz-id', 'mike-id', 'admin');

-- Mike can access:
-- - /dashboard/personal (his freelance work)
-- - /dashboard/acme-corp (as editor)
-- - /dashboard/startup-xyz (as admin)
```

## 🔐 Security Testing

### Test RLS Policies

```sql
-- Test 1: Personal business isolation
-- User A should NOT see User B's businesses
SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'user-a-id';

SELECT * FROM businesses WHERE owner_user_id = 'user-b-id';
-- Should return 0 rows (RLS blocks it)

-- Test 2: Team member access
SET LOCAL request.jwt.claims.sub TO 'team-member-id';

SELECT * FROM brand_kits WHERE business_id = 'business-id';
-- Should return kits if user is member, blocked otherwise

-- Test 3: Share token public access
-- Should work without authentication
SELECT * FROM share_tokens WHERE token = 'public-token';
-- Returns token info if valid and not expired
```

## 🛠️ Next Steps to Complete

### 1. Create Onboarding Flows (1-2 hours)

**Personal Onboarding:**
```
app/onboarding/personal/page.tsx

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  const user = await requireUser();
  const body = await request.json();

  // Extract context
  const { businessId, ...brandKitData } = body;

  const context: BrandKitContext = {
    userId: user.id,
    businessId: businessId || undefined,
    accountType: 'personal', // Get from user_profiles
  };

  const brandKit = await createBrandKit(context, brandKitData);
  return NextResponse.json(brandKit);
}
```

### 3. Create Dashboard Layouts (3-4 hours)

**Personal Dashboard:**
```typescript
// app/dashboard/personal/page.tsx
- List owned businesses
- List personal brand kits
- Quick stats
```

**Business Dashboard:**
```typescript
// app/dashboard/[businessSlug]/page.tsx
- Team overview
- Recent brand kits
- Activity feed
```

### 4. Add Business Management UI (2-3 hours)

```typescript
// app/dashboard/personal/businesses/new/page.tsx
- Business creation form
- Slug generation
- Onboarding data collection
```

### 5. Implement Team Management (3-4 hours)

```typescript
// app/dashboard/[businessSlug]/team/page.tsx
- List team members
- Invite flow
- Role management
- Member activity
```

## 🎯 Migration Strategy

If you have existing data from the old schema:

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended)
1. Drop old tables
2. Run new schema
3. Create test accounts

### Option 2: Migrate Existing Data
```sql
-- Migrate users to user_profiles
INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, full_name, account_type)
SELECT id, raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', 'business'
FROM auth.users;

-- Migrate companies to businesses (as registered)
INSERT INTO businesses (id, name, slug, is_registered, owner_user_id)
SELECT id, name, slug, true, NULL
FROM companies;

-- Migrate company_users to business_members
INSERT INTO business_members (business_id, user_id, role, status)
SELECT company_id, user_id, role, status
FROM company_users;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Row-level security policy error"
- Check user is authenticated
- Verify `owner_user_id` or team membership
- Ensure business not soft-deleted (`deleted_at IS NULL`)

### "Constraint violation: business must be registered"
- Can't add team members to personal business
- Either set `is_registered=true` OR remove `owner_user_id`

### "User profile not created"
- Check trigger is active: `SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created'`
- Manually create if needed

### "Can't access business"
- Run: `SELECT user_can_access_business('user-id', 'business-id')`
- Should return `true` if access granted
